Today I went into a sensory deprivation isolation tank.

It was a great and relaxing experience. I recommend it.

I went with my brother. We walked in and signed a paper basically saying 'you can't sue us'.

There was a notebook on the table where others could write out their experiences of their floats.
People drew and wrote funny things about their floats. One of my favorites was:
"Death is no longer a fear."
"Birth and death are the same."
There was also a picture of a naked guy going down an endless stream of water, like a water slide.

Basically after seeing the notebook my expectations were high.

We had a session planned from 1pm-4:30pm. A whopping 3.5 hours.
It was a bit too long. 1.5 to 2hrs is what I recommend.

Before you go into the tank you shower off, and put some earplugs in.
I stepped into the buoyant water. And lowered my self.
I was floating.

In the tank I felt the endless bounds of darkness.
I felt utter relaxation.
I firstly concentrated on my breaths, and then left the rest to my mind.

I could feel myself relaxing into a unique rest/sleep.
I had my eyes closed and open.
Closing and opening my eyes felt synonymous.
It was confusing...

After walking out of the tank I stood up and I stood tall.

I showered off and left the building, enjoying the beauty of Light!

Afterall, life is just a bunch of lights.

The Past and Future and Present are all great distractions aren't they?
But how about the present.

From going into the tank I've learned much about how to control your mind.
But to know what I'm talking about, you should try the tank yourself!
