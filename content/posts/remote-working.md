In this article I will share with you some tips for working remotely.

# Setup a Single Source of Truth
Establish a readable document for you and your team to reference.
Keep your documentation as up to date and as terse as possible, people won't want to read huge multi page documents unless they are a speed reader.
To do this, I would recommend using a cloud based text editor or another collaborative program.
The main benefit of this is that knowledge won't be lost by verbal communication. Another is that it should
lower the amount of time spent in meetings.

# Designate a Workspace
It is important to have a workspace for you to concentrate on your work. Try and limit distractions
as much as possible. Put your phone on silent for up to an hour at a time. Only check it during a break.

# Take Breaks and Stretch
Take breaks and stretch. Stretch your arms over your head behind your back, anything to reverse the hunch you inevitably
have with your computer use. Put your hands together (like a prayer: üôè) and push them against eachother
to give your wrists a good stretching.

And if you aren't using a mouse I would recommend it! I use a bluetooth trackball logitech mouse.

# Establish Goals
Set small achievable goals to accomplish throughout the day. Many times people look at a task in too large of a chunk.
In reality most big projects are accomplished in smaller steps.

"Practice makes perfect", No one just suddenly becomes a master of something in one sitting. 
And no one can complete a huge project in one sitting. Use a task management tool to help you navigate and visualize
your goals with small achievable steps.

# Meetings Have Purpose
Make sure meetings have a clear and desired outcome. Do you have meetings scheduled that are ritualistic, but with
no clear goal? Ask yourself why you even have that meeting if it is not fruitful.

# Ask Why
I would encourage you to keep curious. Ask why you are doing things a certain way and you will improve. Along with tip #3, taking a walk around the block and thinking about how you are solving your problems may help you come to different solutions.
