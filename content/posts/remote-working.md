Remote work is becoming more common, but it requires a different approach than traditional office work. In this article, I‚Äôll share some tips that can help you stay productive, maintain a healthy work-life balance, and improve your remote work experience.

### 1. Set Up a Single Source of Truth

Clear and accessible documentation is a game-changer for remote teams. Create a central place where your team can easily find important information, like project plans, updates, and guidelines. Keep it concise and up to date. People aren‚Äôt going to want to read long, detailed documents unless they absolutely have to.

I recommend using a cloud-based collaborative tool, like Confluence, so everyone can contribute and edit in real time. This way, knowledge stays preserved and accessible, without relying on meetings or just word of mouth.

**Pro tip:** Keep it simple. The easier the document is to read and understand, the more likely your team will use it regularly.

### 2. Create a Dedicated Workspace

Having a space just for work is really important when working remotely. Find a quiet area where you can concentrate and try to limit distractions.

If possible, set up your workspace to be comfortable and ergonomic. Use a good chair, desk, and monitor setup to avoid physical strain. And remember, it doesn‚Äôt need to be a full office. A corner of your room or even a specific table can work as long as it helps you stay focused.

**Pro tip:** If you can, try not to access your work area after hours. This helps keep a clear boundary between your work and personal life.

### 3. Take Breaks and Stay Active

Long hours of sitting is not too good for you (relevant for in-office and remote work). Make it a habit to take regular breaks to stretch, walk around, and give your mind a quick refresh. Stretching your arms, back, and wrists can help alleviate the tension from long periods of typing.

One simple stretch: put your hands together (like in a prayer position üôè), push your palms together, and hold for 15-30 seconds to stretch your wrists. You can also consider using a standing desk or an ergonomic trackball mouse (I recommend the Logitech Bluetooth trackball).

**Pro tip:** Try using the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It helps keep you energized and focused all day.

### 4. Set Clear, Achievable Goals

Remote work can feel isolating sometimes, but setting clear, small goals makes it easier to stay on track. Break down larger projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. When you do this, it‚Äôs easier to see progress, and the work doesn‚Äôt feel as overwhelming.

It‚Äôs like they say: ‚ÄúPractice makes perfect.‚Äù No one becomes an expert in one go, and no large project gets done all at once. Use task management tools like Jira (or whatever TM tool) to keep track of your tasks and see your progress.

**Pro tip:** At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on what you‚Äôve accomplished and set your goals for the next day to keep the momentum going.

### 5. Make Sure Meetings Have a Purpose

Meetings are a part of remote work, but they need to have a clear goal. Before scheduling or joining a meeting, ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the desired outcome?‚Äù If you can‚Äôt answer that, then the meeting might not be necessary.

**Pro tip:** Create an agenda for meetings and share it ahead of time. This keeps everyone focused and ensures that the meeting is productive.

### 6. Stay Curious and Ask Why

One of the best things about remote work is the freedom it gives you. But with that freedom comes the opportunity to stop questioning your own methods. Keep asking yourself why you‚Äôre doing things a certain way. Challenge your processes and see if there‚Äôs a better way to solve problems. 

Sometimes, just stepping away from your desk, like taking a walk outside, can help you think through challenges with fresh eyes. Don‚Äôt be afraid to question the old ways of doing things and look for new solutions.

**Pro tip:** Keep a notebook nearby to jot down ideas when they come to you. You‚Äôll be surprised at how often inspiration hits when you‚Äôre not actively trying to figure something out.

### Final Thoughts

Remote work can be incredibly rewarding, but it does require some effort and discipline. By setting clear goals, maintaining an organized workspace, staying active, and ensuring meetings are purposeful, you can create an environment that supports both personal well-being and professional success.
