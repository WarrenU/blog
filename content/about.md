My name is Warren, and I like to program with Python and Golang. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Game Science from UC Irvine. I am especially skilled at creating web API's and have used Flask, and Django for those backends. I started to learn about web development around 2015 when the MEAN stack was hot. Then I learned how to use Django, and have enjoyed the brevity of python. Currently am using Flask and FastAPI. I am starting this blog to share my thoughts and interesting finds while working as a backend focused engineer.
