<h1 id="setup-a-single-source-of-truth">Setup a Single Source of Truth</h1>
<p>Establish a readable document for you and your team to reference.
Keep your documentation as up to date and as terse as possible, people won&rsquo;t want to read huge multi page documents unless they are a speed reader.
To do this, I would recommend using a cloud based text editor or another collaborative program.
The main benefit of this is that knowledge won&rsquo;t be lost by verbal communication. Another is that it should
lower the amount of time spent in meetings.</p>
<p><img src="/images/superspeedreading.jpg" alt="superman"></p>
<h1 id="designate-a-workspace">Designate a Workspace</h1>
<p>It is important to have a workspace for you to concentrate on your work. Try and limit distractions
as much as possible. Put your phone on silent for up to an hour at a time. Only check it during a break.</p>
<h1 id="take-breaks-and-stretch">Take Breaks and Stretch</h1>
<p>Take breaks and stretch. Stretch your arms over your head behind your back, anything to reverse the hunch you inevitably
have with your computer use. Put your hands together (like a prayer: üôè) and push them against eachother
to give your wrists a good stretching.</p>
<p>And if you aren&rsquo;t using a mouse I would recommend it! I use a bluetooth trackball logitech mouse.</p>
<h1 id="establish-goals">Establish Goals</h1>
<p>Set small achievable goals to accomplish throughout the day. Many times people look at a task in too large of a chunk.
In reality most big projects are accomplished in smaller steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practice makes perfect&rdquo;, No one just suddenly becomes a master of something in one sitting.
And no one can complete a huge project in one sitting. Use a task management tool to help you navigate and visualize
your goals with small achievable steps.</p>
<h1 id="meetings-have-purpose">Meetings Have Purpose</h1>
<p>Make sure meetings have a clear and desired outcome. Do you have meetings scheduled that are ritualistic, but with
no clear goal? Ask yourself why you even have that meeting if it is not fruitful.</p>
<h1 id="ask-why">Ask Why</h1>
<p>I would encourage you to keep curious. Ask why you are doing things a certain way and you will improve. Along with tip #3, taking a walk around the block and thinking about how you are solving your problems may help you come to different solutions.</p>
