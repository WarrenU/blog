<p>It was a great and relaxing experience. I recommend it.</p>

<p>I went with my brother. We walked in and signed a paper basically saying &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t sue us&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There was a notebook on the table where others could write out their experiences of their floats.
People drew and wrote funny things about their floats. One of my favorites was:
&ldquo;Death is no longer a fear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Birth and death are the same.&rdquo;
There was also a picture of a naked guy going down an endless stream of water, like a water slide.</p>

<p>Basically after seeing the notebook my expectations were high.</p>

<p>We had a session planned from 1pm-4:30pm. A whopping 3.5 hours.
It was a bit too long. 1.5 to 2hrs is what I recommend.</p>

<p>Before you go into the tank you shower off, and put some earplugs in.
I stepped into the buoyant water. And lowered my self.
I was floating.</p>

<p>In the tank I felt the endless bounds of darkness.
I felt utter relaxation.
I firstly concentrated on my breaths, and then left the rest to my mind.</p>

<p>I could feel myself relaxing into a unique rest/sleep.
I had my eyes closed and open.
Closing and opening my eyes felt synonymous.
It was confusing&hellip;</p>

<p>After walking out of the tank I stood up and I stood tall.</p>

<p>I showered off and left the building, enjoying the beauty of Light!</p>

<p>Afterall, life is just a bunch of lights.</p>

<p>The Past and Future and Present are all great distractions aren&rsquo;t they?
But how about the present.</p>

<p>From going into the tank I&rsquo;ve learned much about how to control your mind.
But to know what I&rsquo;m talking about, you should try the tank yourself!</p>
